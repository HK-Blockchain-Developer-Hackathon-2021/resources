# HK Blockchain Developer Hackathon 2021 Instructions

Welcome! Here you will find the instructions on how to have a successful journey at HK Blockchain Developer Hackathon 2021.

## First of all, how much rewards would you get?

We will have 15,000 ALGO for Startup Group and another 15,000 ALGO for Student Group. The winner team of each group will also be awarded a Ledger Nano wallet for each of the team member.

The distribution of the rewards will be based on voting result. Each group will be voted ranked seperately.

We will have judges to vote for the team, and also have the teams to vote each other teams.

Each judge will have 2 votes and each team will have 1 vote.
