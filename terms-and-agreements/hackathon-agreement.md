# Hackathon Agreement

THIS HACKATHON AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) is entered  into between ALGORAND FOUNDATION, LTD., a public company limited by guarantee incorporated under the laws of Singapore (“**Foundation”**), and hackathon participants (the “**Awardee”**).  Each of Awardee and Foundation may be individually referred to as “**Party**” and, collectively, as “**Parties**”. 

**BACKGROUND**

Terms as capitalised in this AGREEMENT shall have the meanings as ascribed to them in the Terms and Conditions of the Algorand Foundation Hackathon Program. 

The Awardee is engaged in a project (the “**Project**”) to maintain and further develop an innovative and decentralized blockchain protocol (the “**Algorand Network**”).  The Foundation desires to award the Awardee a reward to assist in maintaining and further developing the Algorand Network under the terms of the Algorand Foundation Hackathon.  All work performed under this AGREEMENT and any applicable Work Schedules (“**Services**”) will be conducted in accordance with, and subject to the terms of this AGREEMENT and the Algorand Foundation Hackathon.  In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows.    

1. **Effective Date**

   1. The effective date of this AGREEMENT is the date Awardee sign up for the Hackathon (“**Effective Date**”). The Services shall commence on the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT, and shall continue until the Services have been completed, or this AGREEMENT is terminated in accordance with the terms of this AGREEMENT.

2. **Services**

   1. <u>Scope of Services</u>.  Awardee will perform the Services and deliver the deliverables (“**Deliverables**”) described in any Hackathon Schedule. If there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of any Hackathon Schedule and any portion of this AGREEMENT, the relevant term or condition of the Hackathon Schedule will control and prevail.  
   2. <u>Schedule</u>.  Awardee agrees to perform the Services and complete the Deliverables in accordance with the schedule of the Hackathon.
   3. <u>Project Schedule Delays</u>. The Foundation and Awardee agree that the Services and delivery timetable shall be adjusted to proportionately and reasonably reflect the following when determining Awardee’s compliance with such delivery timetable: (i) mutually agreed upon delays confirmed in writing by each party; (ii) delays to the extent attributable to Foundation’s failure to respond to or answer any questions and inquiries of Awardee that are required to complete the Deliverables or necessary for the performance of the Services; (iii) delays to the extent attributable to the implementation of changes to the Services / Deliverables agreed to by the parties.  Awardee agrees to promptly advise the Foundation of any information or approval that Awardee is dependent on to provide the Services or complete any Deliverable and to which Foundation is late in providing.
   4. <u>Change Requests</u>.  During the term of a Hackathon Schedule, a Party may request a change to the scope of the Services or Deliverables covered by the Hackathon Schedule (a “**Change Request**”) by notifying the other Party of the requested change.  After the receiving Party receives a Change Request, such Party will provide a reasonably prompt response to the requesting Party indicating such Party’s views on the feasibility of implementing the change, and the Parties will work in good faith to agree on such Change Request.  If the Parties agree to change the Hackathon Schedule, Awardee will draft a document describing the change to the Services or Deliverables and the responsibilities of each Party in connection with such change (including any proposed change in applicable level of Hackathon) (a “**Change Order**”), for signature by both Parties to memorialize the change. No changes may be made to any Hackathon Schedule by a Party, and no changes by either Party will be deemed part of any Hackathon Schedule, unless a Change Order is agreed to, and accepted by both Parties.  Both Parties will continue to proceed under the existing terms and conditions of a Hackathon Schedule until a Change Order is accepted by both Parties. 

3. **Foundation Responsibilities**

   1. Foundation shall coordinate information gathering and data reasonably required to complete the Deliverables.

4. **Confidential Information**

   1. Both Parties acknowledge that they may acquire information from the other Party (“**Disclosing Party**”) of a competitively sensitive or proprietary nature in connection with the work done or Services performed by Awardee (“**Confidential Information**”).  The Party receiving the Confidential Information (“**Receiving Party**”) agrees to hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence.  The Receiving Party agrees that it will not disclose any such Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party’s consent.  These restrictions shall not apply to (a) information generally available to the public, (b) already known by the Receiving Party, or (c) information released by the Disclosing Party generally without restriction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, the Receiving Party may disclose information to the extent required by an order of any court or other governmental authority, but only after the Receiving Party has notified the Disclosing Party and given the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to obtain protection for such information in connection with such disclosure. 

5. **Personnel**

   1. Awardee shall be responsible for selecting the personnel to perform its obligations under this AGREEMENT. The personnel may include employees or contractors, provided that any such personnel agrees to abide by Awardee’s obligations under this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions of the Hackathon Program.

Within the Warranty Period, the Foundation shall either notify Awardee that (i) the Deliverables comply with the requirements of this AGREEMENT; or (ii) that there are deficiencies in the Deliverables (“**Deficiencies**”) that require correction by Awardee. In the event that the Foundation delivers any notices of Deficiencies to Awardee, the Foundation shall provide reasonable detail of the nature of such Deficiencies. Awardee shall use reasonable efforts, at its own expense, to correct any Deficiencies as quickly as is reasonably possible after receiving notice of Deficiencies. Upon notice from Awardee to the Foundation of correction, the Foundation shall review to determine whether Awardee has cured the Deficiencies listed in the notice. The foregoing process shall be repeated until the Deliverables comply with the requirements of this AGREEMENT provided that if Awardee is unable to deliver the Deliverables in conformance with the requirements of the AGREEMENT to the satisfaction of the Foundation within a reasonable period of time, the Foundation may elect to terminate this AGREEMENT.  If this AGREEMENT is terminated in accordance with this Section 6(a),the Foundation may elect to either (i) return the Deliverables to Awardee and pursue full refund of any Rewards (as set forth in Section 9) or (ii) retain the Deliverables and not pursue refund of the Fees.
